# Testings
I am conducting security assessments on my batchmates' websites.
If I discover any vulnerabilities while using this application or during my testing, I will report them by raising an issue and documenting it here. Vigilance and assistance in improving the security of our web applications are highly appreciated. 

We take the security of our applications seriously. Once a vulnerability is reported, our team will promptly investigate and work on a resolution. We value your efforts in helping us maintain a secure online environment for everyone.

Thank you !!
